Game Description:

Do you like trolling your friends? Watching them get angered by a basic game with a simple objective? Then this is a game for you!
A simple fun game that involves you (a green ball) four pieces of deliciously baked bread in the corners, and a dream...
...Oh yeah and a few angry Ducks hoarding the bread...
...Don't worry about them they're harmless...
...Unless they touch you...
Objective: Eat as much bread as you can by using (W,S,A,D to move up, down, left, right) to run into the bread consuming it and feast like your life depends on it...
...Which of course your life doesn't depend on it per say...unless the ducks touch you...
...Anyways goodluck, have fun, and pass this onto your friends with your high score.
Bottom line- Get a really high score, challenge a friend to beat it, watch them struggle at beating it and talk mad trash the whole time. Enjoy! :D
